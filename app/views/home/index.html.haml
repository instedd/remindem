  Remindem is great for any kind of reminder you'd like to send.

  Here are a few ways you might use it, but you're limited only by your imagination:

  %h2 Expecting Mothers
  .icon-container.left
    %span.i96grad-pregnant
  %p Mothers-to-be have a lot on their plates, and it's easy to forget details like taking vitamin supplements or showing up for scheduled checkups. Then there's the variety of little changes that might alarm a brand-new mother who doesn't know quite what to expect -- or when to expect it. Why not make the road to motherhood a little easier with Remindem? Whether you're a health care practitioner, an insurance professional, or just a worried mother-in-law, you can set up a series of timed reminders to help Mom make it through her pregnancy with flying colors.

  %p Got a classroom full of students juggling school, work, family, friends, mandatory goof-off time, etc.? Help them get assignments in on time and make the grade with Remindem. Tests, meeting times, study objectives, even scheduled pep talks -- when it comes to education, Remindem gets an A+.

  %h2 Diabetics
  .icon-container.left
    %span.i96grad-diabetic
  %p Properly managed, diabetes doesn't have to keep patients from doing all the things they love. Send disease management tips, dietary reminders, insulin dosing schedules, and more with Remindem. Remindem even makes it easy to create separate messaging projects based on disease staging, patient age, and other criteria.

  %h2 Child immunizations
  .icon-container.left
    %span.i96grad-vaccine
  %p Properly scheduled immunizations are critical to a child's continuing well-being and development. Help parents keep their children healthy with immunization reminders from Remindem. Once parents register using a keyword you specify, they'll begin receiving text reminders tailored to their child's age, minimizing missed or late vaccinations and preventable illnesses that can keep children from reaching their full potential.

  %h1 How does it work?
  %p Begin by creating your list of messages and choosing a custom keyword that people will text to your number to subscribe. If desired, you can assign a time interval to each of the messages in your list. When a user subscribes, the clock starts ticking, and he or she will receive each message at the specified time. If your messages are not linked to a specific timeline, such as helpful tips for managing a chronic illness, Remindem can send them randomly.
  %p Remindem requires a mobile phone to receive signup texts and send out reminders, though the Web app is used to create messages and schedule their delivery. To begin sending reminders, just download the free Nuntium application to your Android-powered phone (or to your computer, if you don't have an Android phone), making sure your phone has credit, Internet access, and mobile reception. Once your phone is connected to our server wirelessly or via your computer, Remindem automatically sends text messages to subscribers on your schedule.
